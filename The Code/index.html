            <div>
                <p>"Loon's Eye is a weekly stop of mine. I am always excited to find new vinyl that just came in. It is exciting to see what they bring in because there is always great variety." -Jakob G.</p>
                <p>"While many places have stopped carrying CDs altogether, they keep the format alive and well. I am always able to find albums from my favorite artists. The friendly staff has even ordered copies for me that were not in stock." -Big Cat</p>
                <P>"The store is always so easy to navigate. Everything is so well organized and laid out." -Blake G.</P>
